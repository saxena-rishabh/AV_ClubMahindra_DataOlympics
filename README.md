## Problem Statement
Given around ~300,000 reservations across 32 different hotels/holiday homes of Club Mahindra the objective is to predict the average spend of customers per room per night stay at the hotel against the booking. A wide variety of attributes on the reservation were provided which includes
`booking_date`, `checkin_date`, `checkout_date` etc. Please visit the [competition homepage](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/club-mahindra-dataolympics/) for more information on the problem statement and the dataset.
